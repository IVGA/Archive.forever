# Archive.forever
Uses a distributed blockchain to store web site archives.

* Create a simple front end
* Allow users to submit links
* Use storj.io as the blockchain source
* Create a wget helper to gather that link and pump its results into storj
* Create a link GUID based off file checksums.
* Return that link to the user
* Allow searching of links

Building this now and making it open source so others can use it as well. :D
